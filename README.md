# CSCI596 Final Project

## The association of Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome (OSAS) with Cognitive Impairment and Dementia.




## Study Goals/Objectives:

+ The purpose of the study is to compare the predicted brain biological age with the true chronological age of subjects with OSA and MCI (Mild Cognitive Impairment). 

+ The main hypothesis to test is: If OSA with CI patients show similar aging patterns and morphological changing, this can signify that OSA CI is a subtype of MCI that may lead to Dementia if left without treatment.
