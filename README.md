# CSCI596 Final Project

## The association of Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome (OSAS) with Cognitive Impairment and Dementia.

<br/><br/>


## Study Goals/Objectives:

+ The purpose of the study is to compare the predicted brain biological age with the true chronological age of subjects with OSA and MCI (Mild Cognitive Impairment). 

+ The main hypothesis to test is: If OSA with CI patients show similar aging patterns and morphological changing, this can signify that OSA CI is a subtype of MCI that may lead to Dementia if left without treatment.

##Datasets:

+I will be using SMC (Samsung Medical Center) data for OSA, ADNI, and ICBM. Some OSA subjects may have Cognitive Impairment (CI) and some don’t have CI. I will be using ADNI MCI (Mild Cognitive Impairment) and Control healthy subjects. I will be using control healthy subjects from ICBM.

+I will be using Males in the analysis because females may have many complications that affect their sleep patterns.

+I will be using MRI T1 weighted Images in addition to some measures like Cognitive scores for OSA. The MRI images will be used to extract features on the brain.

+There are 59 OSA without cognitive impairment and 17 OSA subjects with CI. However,I will use 13 OSA with CI, and 52 OSA without CI because I don’t have the feature files for the rest.

+There are 23 Normal OSA subjects with feature files.

+There are 152 ADNI CN male subjects with feature files.

+There are 44 ICBM CN male subjects with feature files.

+There are 390 ADNI MCI male subjects with feature files.
